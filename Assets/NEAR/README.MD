# Overview

This Unity plugin makes it straightforward to integrate with the NEAR blockchain. The following functionality is supported:

- Wallet Sign In
- Get account details
- Contract method calls 

## Limitations

Now supports Android, iOS and WebGL!
Also 'works' in the Unity Editor but you must paste the deep link generated by your wallet login.

## Installation / Build Example

Build Setting -> Platform = WebGL

Player Settings -> Player -> Resolution and Presentation -> WebGL Template = NEARWS

Build

## Details

Both the more minimal near-api-js and the richer wallet-selector apis are supported. The NFTScene and ContractScene use the near-api-js api and the WSScene uses the wallet-selector api. The advantage of the wallet-selector api is that it gives a choice of multiple different wallets. 2 html templates are offered, NEARJS only supports the near-api-js but NEARWS supports both. If in doubt use NEARWS but NEARJS is more minimal and will be faster to load if you don't need the multiple wallet support.
